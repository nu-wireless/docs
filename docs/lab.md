# Wireless Lab Rules and Expectations

:::info

The Wireless Club lab/shack/makerspace is located in 503 Hayden Hall. If you are
a Wireless member approved for independent lab access, you will be issued a door
code. The lab is accessible at all times under normal circumstances.

:::

## General Expectations

The club space is accessible for members with door codes. We encourage you to
use the lab for personal projects, coursework, or club-related activities.
Please remember that this is a communal space for club members, and you must
show respect for club property, other members, and personal belongings.

There are computers in the lab available to members of the club. Please be
aware that these computers are connected to the university network and
therefore subject to [university policy on network
use](https://policies.northeastern.edu/policy700/). Priority should be given to
ham radio operation for the computer connected to the radio at the back of the
shack.

We encourage that you use electronic components and other consumables provided
by the club in your personal projects in a reasonable manner. For order
requests, please contact the [Lab Manager](https://nuwireless.org/officers).

Failure to meet lab space expectations may lead to penalties, suspension or
revocation of independent lab access.

## Obtaining Lab Access

In order to be eligible to apply for lab access, you must fulfill these
criteria:

1. Join the Wireless Club Slack
2. Be a current Northeastern student
3. Attend at least **three** Wireless Club events during the current cycle
   (meetings, workshops, outings)

Door codes are active until the end of the current **cycle**. Each year is split
into two cycles:

- **Fall Cycle**: July 1st - December 31st
- **Spring Cycle**: January 1st - June 30th

Once you are eligible, you can apply for a door code by following instructions
posted on [our website](https://nuwireless.org/lab). We charge a $10
non-refundable fee for lab access per cycle.

:::warning

Door codes are issued to individuals and under no circumstances should be shared
with anyone else. If you violate this rule, your access will be **terminated**.
If you accidentally leak your code, you should report it immediately to an
[officer of the club](https://nuwireless.org/officers).

:::

:::info

If you held a door code during the previous cycle, you can skip requirement 3
and apply for renewal immediately.

## Safety Guidelines

The Wireless lab contains equipment which can cause personal harm if not
handled properly. It's expected that you understand the dangers and know how to
use a tool, if you choose to do so. **Do not use tools you are not familiar
with**.

General safety guidelines:

- Be aware and be alert
- Know the dangers of materials and tools you are using.
- Wear gloves when working with chemicals.
- Do not start fires.

Safety guidelines for the **soldering stations**:

- Wear glasses of some sort.
- Use an ESD strap when working with sensitive electronics.
- Keep flammable items and materials away from the station.
- Have proper airflow when soldering.
- Turn off soldering equipment when you are done.

Safety guidelines for **power tools**

- Wear glasses of some sort.
- Do not operate power tools while wearing loose clothing.
- Tie back long hair and remove loose jewelry.

## Personal Items

If you are frequently in the lab and work on personal projects, you may request
a drawer for storing personal project items. Vacant drawers may be assigned to
members by club leadership

Drawer allocations generally will persist while you are a part of the club and
continue holding a door code, unless it remains empty for a long time. You may
also give up your drawer at any time. If you do not renew your door code
access, your drawer allocated may be forfeited (although you will be notified
beforehand).

Storing personal items outside of drawers must be approved with club
leadership. If you are unsure if you are able to keep something in the lab,
please contact the Lab Manager.

## Tool Usage

In order to use certain tools and equipment in the shack, you **must** speak and
be approved by the Lab Manager and complete any training required.

:::warning

The tools which **require approval** are:

- HF radio setup (back of the shack)
- 3D Printers
- Power tools (excluding drills & impactors)

:::

Some tools don't require explicit permission, but should not be used unless you
are comfortable with them. This items are either difficult to replace/repair if
used incorrectly or can cause personal harm. If you are unsure, please take the
time to learn from *a member of the club* before using them on your own.

:::info

The tools you should be *cautious* with are:

- Soldering equipment
- Electronic test equipment (oscilloscopes, network analyzers, etc.)
- Power drills & impactors

:::

## Borrowing Equipment

Consumables are available to all members for personal projects without needing
to check anything out. A limited number of more valuable items are available to
check out for project use. Equipment like will always be marked with an **asset
tag**.

If you are interested in learning what items can be checked out or how the
process works, please speak with the Lab Manager.

## Special Circumstances

Under extraordinary circumstances, parts of the lab or the entire lab may be
temporarily inaccessible for general use. Examples include radio maintenance,
facilities maintenance, or event preparation.

A notice will be posted on the door of the lab and via Slack to explain the
situation.

## Guests

Guests, excluding individuals under sanctions, can be brought into the lab by
door code holders. If you bring someone to the lab or allow someone outside
in, **you are responsible for their actions while they remain
in the club space**. This rule does not apply when the lab is open to the
general public, such as during weekly meetings, public events, and ham exams.

It is perfectly understandable that you may need to step out of the lab briefly;
however you may not leave guests unattended in the club space. If you need to
leave the lab for more than a short period, please take your guest with you or
coordinate with another door code holder to supervise them.

## Access Revocation

Failure to follow rules outlined in this document may lead to an official
warning or revocation of lab access, as deemed appropriate by the officer board.

The current *President*, *Vice-President*, and *Lab Manager* are able to:
- Issue warnings to members.
- Suspend lab access for up to a week for major offences or during
  investigations.

Full access revocation may only be administered though a majority vote at
an officer board meeting.

If your lab access was revoked, you may be deemed ineligible for lab access in
the future based on the discretion of the officer board.

## Emergency Response

Please make note of the location of the fire extinguisher attached to the
central column in the main room. If you believe club equipment was stolen, you
should report the incident to the officer board.

:::danger

If you are unable to extinguish the fire by your own means, **exit the lab and
pull the fire alarm immediately on your left**. Exit the building, wait for
authorities to show up and explain the situation to them.

:::

:::warning

You must report emergencies related to the club space to [Wireless
leadership](https://nuwireless.org/officers). Please ensure your personal safety
and follow orders of public safety officials before reaching out by any means
necessary.
