# Wireless Lab Rules and Expectations

:::info

The Wireless Club lab/shack/makerspace is located in 503 Hayden Hall. If you are
a Wireless member approved for independent lab access, you will be issued a door
code. The lab is accessible at all times under normal circumstances.

:::

## General Expectations

The club space is accessible for members with door codes. We encourage that you
use the lab to work on personal projects, coursework or for club-related
activities. Please be mindful that this is a communal space for club members and
you must show respect for club property, other members, and personal belongings.

There are computers in the lab which are available to members of the club.
Please be aware that computers are connected to the university network and
therefore subject to [university policy on network
use](https://policies.northeastern.edu/policy700/). Priority should be given to
ham radio operation for the computer connected to the radio in the back of the
shack.

We encourage that you use electronic components and other consumables provided
by the club in your personal projects in a reasonable manner. For order
requests, please contact the [Lab Manager](https://nuwireless.org/officers).

Failure to meet lab space expectations may lead to penalties, suspension or
revocation of independent lab access.

## Obtaining Lab Access

In order to be eligible to apply for lab access, you must fulfill these
criteria:

1. Join the Wireless Club Slack
2. Be a current Northeastern student
3. Attend at least **three** Wireless Club events during the current cycle
   (meetings, workshops, outings)

Door codes are active until the end of the current **cycle**. Each year is split
into two cycles:

- **Fall Cycle**: July 1st - December 31st
- **Spring Cycle**: January 1st - June 30th

Once you are eligible, you can apply for a door code by following instructions
posted on [our website](https://nuwireless.org/lab). We charge a $10
non-refundable fee for lab access per cycle.

:::warning

Door codes are issued to individuals and under no circumstances should be shared
with anyone else. If you violate this rule, your access will be **terminated**.
If you accidentally leak your code, you should report it immediately to an
[officer of the club](https://nuwireless.org/officers).

If you held a door code during the previous cycle, you can skip requirement 3
and apply for renewal immediately.
