# Wireless Lab Rules and Expectations

:::info

The Wireless Club lab/shack/makerspace is located in Hayden Hall, Room 503. Take the elevator to the fourth floor, then follow the signs leading to the staircase up to the club. If you are a Wireless Club member approved for independent lab access, you will be issued a door code. The lab is accessible at all times under normal circumstances.

While this document is primarily intended for current members, visitors are welcome during public events or by contacting the club. For visit inquiries or collaborations (e.g., international amateur radio guests), please reach out via [our website](https://nuwireless.org).

Please remember that the lab is a shared space. Many tools and resources are fragile, potentially hazardous, or difficult to replace or repair if damaged. Treat all equipment and workspaces with care and respect.


:::

## General Expectations

The club space is accessible for members with door codes. We encourage you to use the lab for personal projects, coursework, or club-related activities.
Please remember that this is a communal space for club members, and you must show respect for club property, other members, and personal belongings.

Computers are available in the lab for club members. Priority should be given to ham radio operation for the computer connected to the radio at the back of the shack. Please be aware that these computers are connected to the university network and
therefore subject to the university's [Policy on Appropriate Use of Computer and Network Resources](https://policies.northeastern.edu/policy700/). 

We encourage that you use electronic components and other consumables provided by the club in your personal projects in a reasonable manner. For order requests, please contact the [Lab Manager](https://nuwireless.org/officers).

Failure to meet lab space expectations may lead to penalties, suspension or revocation of independent lab access.

## Shared Space Conduct

We want the shack to remain a respectful and welcoming environment for all members. Please follow these conduct guidelines when using the space:

- Clean up after yourself promptly.
- Do not monopolize shared tools or workspaces for long periods.
- Keep volume at a respectful level when others are present.
- Avoid leaving open food or drinks near electronics.
- Label any personal tools, projects, or in-progress work clearly.

If you're unsure about what’s appropriate, reach out to an officer or check with another experienced member.


## Obtaining Lab Access

In order to be eligible to apply for lab access, you must fulfill these
criteria:

1. Join the Wireless Club Slack
2. Be a current Northeastern student
3. Attend at least **three** Wireless Club events during the current cycle
   (meetings, workshops, outings)

Door codes are active until the end of the current **cycle**. Each year is split into two cycles:

- **Fall Cycle**: July 1st - December 31st
- **Spring Cycle**: January 1st - June 30th

Once you are eligible, you can apply for a door code by following instructions posted on [our website](https://nuwireless.org/lab). We charge a $10
non-refundable fee for lab access per cycle.

:::warning

Door codes are issued to individuals and under no circumstances should be shared with anyone else. If you violate this rule, your access will be **terminated**.
If you accidentally leak your code, you should report it immediately to an
[officer of the club](https://nuwireless.org/officers).

:::

:::info

If you held a door code during the previous cycle, you can skip requirement 3 and apply for renewal immediately.

## Safety Guidelines

The Wireless lab contains equipment which can cause personal harm if not
handled properly. It's expected that you understand the dangers and know how to
use a tool, if you choose to do so. **Do not use tools you are not familiar
with**.

General safety guidelines:

- Be aware and be alert
- Know the dangers of materials and tools you are using.
- Wear gloves when working with chemicals.
- Do not start fires.

Safety guidelines for the **soldering stations**:

- Wear glasses of some sort.
- Use an ESD strap when working with sensitive electronics.
- Keep flammable items and materials away from the station.
- Have proper airflow when soldering.
- Turn off soldering equipment when you are done.

Safety guidelines for **power tools**

- Wear glasses of some sort.
- Do not operate power tools while wearing loose clothing.
- Tie back long hair and remove loose jewelry.

## Personal Items

If you are frequently in the lab and work on personal projects, you may request
a drawer for storing personal project items. Vacant drawers may be assigned to
members by club leadership

Drawer allocations generally will persist while you are a part of the club and
continue holding a door code, unless it remains empty for a long time. You may
also give up your drawer at any time. If you do not renew your door code
access, your drawer allocated may be forfeited (although you will be notified
beforehand).

Storing personal items outside of drawers must be approved with club
leadership. If you are unsure if you are able to keep something in the lab,
please contact the Lab Manager.

## Tool Usage

In order to use certain tools and equipment in the shack, you **must** speak and
be approved by the Lab Manager and complete any training required.

:::warning

The tools which **require approval** are:

- HF radio setup (back of the shack)
- 3D Printers
- Power tools (excluding drills & impactors)

:::

Some tools don’t require explicit permission, but should only be used if you are confident in your ability to operate them safely. These tools are either difficult to replace/repair if damaged or can cause personal harm. If you are unsure, please take the time to learn from *a member of the club* before using them on your own.

:::info

The tools you should be *cautious* with are:

- Soldering equipment
- Electronic test equipment (oscilloscopes, network analyzers, etc.)
- Power drills & impactors

:::

## Borrowing Equipment

Consumables are available to all members for personal projects without needing
to check anything out. A limited number of more valuable items are available to
check out for project use. Equipment like will always be marked with an **asset
tag**.

If you are interested in learning what items can be checked out or how the
process works, please speak with the Lab Manager.

## Special Circumstances

Under extraordinary circumstances, parts of the lab or the entire lab may be
temporarily inaccessible for general use. Examples include radio maintenance,
facilities maintenance, or event preparation.

A notice will be posted on the door of the lab and via Slack to explain the
situation.

## Visitors

Faculty, alumni, collaborators, and other visitors are welcome during Wireless Club public events (e.g., workshops, meetings, exams). If you are not a current club member and would like to visit the lab outside of a public event, including international guests or visiting hams, please contact us through [our website](https://nuwireless.org).

All visitors must be accompanied by a current member with lab access, and must follow all posted safety guidelines while in the space.


## Guests

Guests, excluding individuals under sanctions, can be brought into the lab by door code holders. If you bring someone to the lab or allow someone outside in, **you are responsible for their actions while they remain
in the club space**. This rule does not apply when the lab is open to the
general public, such as during weekly meetings, public events, and ham exams.

It is perfectly understandable that you may need to step out of the lab briefly; however you may not leave guests unattended in the club space. If you need to leave the lab for more than a short period, please take your guest with you or
coordinate with another door code holder to supervise them.

## Access Revocation

Failure to follow rules outlined in this document may lead to an official
warning or revocation of lab access, as deemed appropriate by the officer board.

The current *President*, *Vice-President*, and *Lab Manager* are able to:
- Issue warnings to members.
- Suspend lab access for up to a week for major offences or during
  investigations.

Full access revocation may only be administered through a majority vote at
an officer board meeting.

If your lab access was revoked, you may be deemed ineligible for lab access in the future based on the discretion of the officer board.

## Emergency Response

**The fire extinguisher is located on the central column** in the main room, as you enter the lab. On that same column, you will also find a basic first aid kit, along with other safety consumables (hair ties, nitrile gloves, sanitizing wipes).

If you believe club equipment has been stolen, please report the incident to the officer board.

:::danger

If you are unable to extinguish the fire by your own means, **exit the lab and pull the fire alarm immediately on your left**. Exit the building, wait for authorities to show up and explain the situation to them.

:::

:::warning

You must report emergencies related to the club space to [Wireless Club
leadership](https://nuwireless.org/officers). Please ensure your personal safety and follow orders of public safety officials before reaching out by any means necessary.
